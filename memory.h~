 * COMP 40 HW 6
 *
 * This module handles memory managemnt for our Universal Machine.
 * The interface allows an instance of memory to be initialized 
 * for a given machine and allows mapping and unmapping of segments.
 *
 * Access to data within segments is done through functions provided
 * by the interface in order to maintain security.

 * if this function is called more than once on a machine, subsequent
 * calls to the function will be ignored as need only be initialized once.
